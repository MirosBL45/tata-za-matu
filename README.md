This is a NextJS app for project tatazamatu.rs

For database, I used hygraph.com

App will be in 2 languages, Serbian and English. Localization is used in hygraph for the text from back. For the static text, localization is on the front of app

Style is going to be done with modules-css.

After clone:
1-> npm install
2-> npm run dev
